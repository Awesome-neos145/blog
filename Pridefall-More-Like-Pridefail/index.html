  <title>Pridefall? More like pridefail.</title>
"I have come here today to tell you about operation pridefall. It is very dangerous and includes IP logging, hacking, and other mischevious stuff. It happens on June 1st."<br>
Obviously what I told you was fake. Pridefall originated as a troll in 2020 targeted directly to (possibly one of the most toxic communities ever) 4chan.<br>
Well, why? As I have read it, "made to doxx (or whatever) the Anti-LGBTQ communities." Yeah.<br>
It's all over reddit. You'll see people telling you to "NOT ENGAGE IN OPERATION PRIDEFALL", Which is a repost of another reddit post.<br>
I don't have the time to deal with this shit. Some people are degenerates. People do this for upvotes or clout.<br>
I fell for it in my DC server. (<a href="https://discord.gg/EKBa7rWH4w">My Server</a>) Yep. I locked it up, realized my mistake, reopened it. That was not fun.<br>
But that's pretty much all I have got to say at this moment.<br>\
